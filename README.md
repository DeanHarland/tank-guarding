# Tanking Fundamentals – A Beginner’s Guide

## Project Overview
This project is a one-page educational website designed to clearly explain the fundamentals of **Tanking** in team-based games. The site mirrors the structure and purpose of a safeguarding information site by focusing on **protection, responsibility, awareness, and correct response** within a team environment.

Just as safeguarding is about protecting vulnerable people, **Tanking is about protecting teammates**, controlling threats, and creating a safe environment for the rest of the team to succeed.

The website is built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, and follows accessibility, user experience, and responsive design principles.
